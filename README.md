# Image-Search-Engine
## About:
This is a demo project on how to build an image retrieval using python. This project uses the concept of content-based image retrieval.

## Content-Based Image Retrieval:
Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a system for retrieving relevant images based on a given image. The system consists of an image query and an image database.
The process of the system will begin by extracting features on all images, whether it’s the query or the image database by using a feature extraction algorithm. Then, the system will calculate similarities between the query with all images on the database. At the end, the system will retrieve all the images that have a great similarity with the query.

## Flowchart of the CBIR:

## Implementation:
To implement the CBIR, we will use Python as the programming language, Tensorflow for feature extraction, and Numpy for calculating the distance. If we summarize, here are the steps that we will do,

• Download the dataset

• Extract features from image database

• Insert the query image and extract its features

• Calculate the similarities with all images

• Retrieve the most similar result

## Overview:
• This is a simple image-based image search engine using Keras + Flask. You can launch the search engine just by running two python scripts.

• offline.py:This script extracts a deep-feature from each database image. Each feature is a 4096D fc6 activation from a VGG16 model with ImageNet pre-trained weights.

• app.py:This script runs a web-server. You can send your query image to the server via a Flask web-interface. The server finds similar images to the query by a simple linear scan.
